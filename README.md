A/B Testing

In A/B testing, we analyze the results of two marketing strategies to choose the best one for future marketing campaigns. For example, when I started an ad campaign on Instagram to promote my Instagram post for the very first time, my target audience was different from the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analyzing the results of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the audience of the second ad campaign as it gave better reach and followers than the first one.

That is what A/B testing means. Your goal can be to boost sales, followers, or traffic, but when we choose the best marketing strategy according to the results of our previous marketing campaigns, it is nothing but A/B testing.

For the task of A/B testing using Python, we need to have a dataset about two different marketing strategies for the same goal. I found a dataset that will help us perform A/B testing. You can download it from here.

In the section below, I will take you through the task of A/B Testing using Python.

The dataset we are using here contains two data files about two marketing campaigns (Control Campaign and Test Campaign). Let’s import the necessary Python libraries and both the datasets to get started with the task of A/B testing:
